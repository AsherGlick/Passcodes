// var DomainSettings = DomainSettings || (function (Math, undefined) { // dont think that I need math but undefined might be useful (maybe)
// 	// Insert the settings variables here


// 	var 
// }(Math)); // Just as the comment at the top states the math library is probably not nessasary



// Ok so this seems to be creating a namespace not just a class
// that would be useful for other things but I dont think that it is what I want for domain settings

var DomainSettings = function(undefined) {
	[[JSVARIABLES]]
	// JSON PARSING or something?
};



// How to store data from a firefox extention?
